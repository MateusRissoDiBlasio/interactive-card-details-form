## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Catch all possible user errors on fulfilling forms is something unbelievable, not sure if I did it on reasonable way, but I tried to, testing a lot.
The logic involved in giving users the correct hints about what went wrong is complex, but pays the effort.

### Continued development

Forms are anywhere we visit online, so understanding how they work and how to manipulate users data, brings interactivity to real world tasks.
